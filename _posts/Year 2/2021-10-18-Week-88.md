Seeing what others can’t see

Feeling what others can’t feel

Hearing what others can’t hear

Tasting what others can’t taste

A veil lifted and tossed aside, 

an afterimage of what you once knew.

Gone.
<br>
<br>

And what remains is a blind light

of a frigid warmth

of a deafening silence

of a soft oblivion

of a sour melancholy

of a cursed blessing

and it’s beautiful.

<br>
<br>
A sight only you can see.

Life’s shades revealed.

All its vibrant colors, movements, and husks of decay,

a richness explored through experience.

<br>
<br>
A strawberry never tasted so sweet,

the brush of the wind so gentle,

the warm embrace of silence

and the awakening of isolation. 

Everything changes for you.

All you did was open your eyes.
